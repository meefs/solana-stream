## Overview

This project provides libraries and tools for streaming real-time data from the Solana blockchain. It supports both Geyser and Shreds approaches, making it easier for developers to access Solana data streams.

## Choose Your Path

- Geyser gRPC (TypeScript/Rust): production-ready streaming with resilient reconnects
- Shreds gRPC (TypeScript/Rust): raw shreds over gRPC for high-throughput ingestion
- UDP Shreds (Rust): lowest-latency signal for real-time event detection

## What's New (TypeScript v1.1.0)

- Refreshed starter layout and docs
- Yellowstone Geyser gRPC connection upgraded to an NAPI-RS-powered client for better backpressure
- NAPI-powered Shreds client/decoder so TypeScript can tap Rust-grade throughput
- Improved backpressure handling and up to 4x streaming efficiency (400% improvement)
- Faster real-time Geyser streams for TypeScript clients with lower overhead

## Production-Ready Geyser Clients (TypeScript + Rust)

- Rust Geyser exports track `yellowstone-grpc-client` 13.x and expose deshred, token-account expansion, and cuckoo filter helpers
- Ping/Pong handling to keep Yellowstone gRPC streams alive
- Exponential reconnect backoff plus gap recovery (`fromSlot` / `from_slot`)
- Bounded queues/channels with drop logging for backpressure safety
- Code-based subscription filters in TypeScript
- Optional runtime metrics logging (TypeScript)
- Default filters drop vote/failed transactions to reduce traffic
- Rust Geyser client ships the same safeguards and powers UDP Shreds for fastest signal

Tip: start with slots, then add filters as needed. When resuming from `fromSlot`,
duplicates are expected.

## Rust Highlight: UDP Shreds (Fastest Signal)

If you have **ERPC Dedicated Shreds**, you can forward raw Shreds over UDP to your own listener.
This is Solana’s fastest observation layer—before Geyser gRPC and far ahead of RPC/WebSocket.
The SDK includes a simple Rust sample; use the `generic_logger` binary to watch any program of your choice.

### Why this is the fastest path

- Shreds arrive first: validator-to-validator Shreds land before Geyser gRPC or RPC/WebSocket,
  so latency-critical flows see events earliest.
- UDP keeps overhead tiny: no connection setup, retransmit, or ordering; matches the on-wire
  format between validators.
- Optional latency monitoring uses a DashMap-backed slot tracker to reduce lock contention.
- Trade-off: pre-finalization data can be missing/out-of-order/failed—handle that as part of the
  speed bargain.

Note: the shared Shreds gRPC endpoint runs over TCP, so it’s slower than UDP Shreds.

### Try it with Solana Stream SDK

- Sample code (`shreds-udp-rs`, Rust): set any program of your own as the watch target.  
  https://github.com/ValidatorsDAO/solana-stream/tree/main/temp-release/shreds-udp-rs
- Quick start requires `settings.jsonc` plus env (e.g., `SOLANA_RPC_ENDPOINT`); see the sample README.
- Dedicated Shreds users: point your Shreds sender to the sample’s `ip:port` to see detections.
- Not on UDP yet? Run it locally or on your own server to explore logs and customize handlers.

### Example log

![program hits over UDP Shreds](https://storage.validators.solutions/SolanaStreamSDKUDPClientExample.jpg)

This example comes from the SDK sample; clone and run it to see hits with your own watch target.

#### Usage with solana-stream-sdk

You can also use the published crate in your own projects:

```toml
[dependencies]
solana-stream-sdk = "1.4.0"
tokio = { version = "1", features = ["rt-multi-thread", "macros"] }
dotenvy = "0.15"
solana-entry = "3.0.12"
bincode = "1.3.3"
```

```rust
use solana_stream_sdk::{CommitmentLevel, ShredstreamClient};
use std::env;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    // Load environment variables
    dotenvy::dotenv().ok();

    // Connect to shreds endpoint
    let endpoint = env::var("SHREDS_ENDPOINT")
        .unwrap_or_else(|_| "https://shreds-ams.erpc.global".to_string());
    let mut client = ShredstreamClient::connect(&endpoint).await?;

    // Create subscription for specific account
    let request = ShredstreamClient::create_entries_request_for_account(
        "6EF8rrecthR5Dkzon8Nwu78hRvfCKubJ14M5uBEwF6P",
        Some(CommitmentLevel::Processed),
    );

    // Subscribe to entries stream
    let mut stream = client.subscribe_entries(request).await?;

    // Process incoming entries
    while let Some(entry) = stream.message().await? {
        let entries = bincode::deserialize::<Vec<solana_entry::entry::Entry>>(&entry.entries)?;
        println!("Slot: {}, Entries: {}", entry.slot, entries.len());

        for entry in entries {
            println!("  Entry has {} transactions", entry.transactions.len());
        }
    }

    Ok(())
}
```

For specific packages, navigate to the package directory and install dependencies.

## Shreds UDP Program Watcher (Rust)

`client/shreds-udp-rs` listens for Shredstream over **UDP** and highlights watched programs (configurable via `settings.jsonc`). Settings live in `client/shreds-udp-rs/settings.jsonc` and are embedded at build time; secrets like RPC can be overridden via environment variables.

Quick start:

```bash
export SOLANA_RPC_ENDPOINT=https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com   # pass secrets via env only
cargo run -p shreds-udp-rs                                       # settings already in settings.jsonc
```

Log legend:

- Prefix: `🎯` program hit, `🐣` authority hit (`🎯🐣` means both)
- Action: `🐣` create, `🟢` buy, `🔻` sell, `🪙` other, `❓` unknown/missing amounts
- Votes skipped by default (`skip_vote_txs=true`)
- SOL values shown are instruction limits; actual fills require event/meta data (e.g., Geyser/RPC).
- UDP shreds are processed directly; not dependent on RPC commitment. Failed transactions may still appear; missing fields show as `❓`.

Components from `crate/solana-stream-sdk` (5 layers):

- Config loader (`ShredsUdpConfig`): reads JSONC/env and builds `ProgramWatchConfig`. Use `watch_config_no_defaults()` to define your own watch set (composite mint finder = SPL Token MintTo/Initialize).
- Receiver (`UdpShredReceiver`): minimal UDP socket reader with timestamps.
- Pipeline (5 layers): ① receive/prefilter (`decode_udp_datagram`) → ② FEC buffer (`insert_shred` + `ShredsUdpState`) → ③ deshred (`deshred_shreds_to_entries`) → ④ watcher/detail (`collect_watch_events` + detailers) → ⑤ sink (logs/custom hooks).
- One-call convenience: `handle_pumpfun_watcher` wraps the same 5 layers (legacy default watcher; set your own watch IDs).
- Customize sink/detailer: via `ProgramWatchConfig::with_detailers(...)` or replace the sink with your own hook.
- Vote filtering: by default `skip_vote_txs=true`, so vote-only shreds/txs are dropped early.
- Samples: `cargo run -p shreds-udp-rs --bin generic_logger` (recommended; set `GENERIC_WATCH_PROGRAM_IDS` / `GENERIC_WATCH_AUTHORITIES` to watch your own programs) or `cargo run -p shreds-udp-rs` (one-call wrapper).

Troubleshooting:

- Use `solana-stream-sdk >= 1.4.0` for Direct Shreds UDP. Agave 3.x serializes deshredded entries with `wincode`; SDK 1.2.0 tried `bincode` first in the UDP helper, and SDK 1.2.1 could still decode from the middle of a multi-FEC entry segment.
- Errors such as `entry decode failed: invalid value: integer ..., expected a valid transaction message version`, `continue signal on byte-three`, `unexpected end of file`, or `alias encoding` usually indicate a codec mismatch rather than firewall loss.
- UDP packet sizes around 1203/1228 bytes are normal Merkle shred sizes and do not by themselves indicate truncation.

Design notes

- Layered pipeline (5 layers): ① UDP receive → ② FEC buffer/pre-deshred → ③ deshred → ④ watcher (mint extraction) → ⑤ detailer/sink (labeling + log output). Each stage can be swapped or reused.
- Pure UDP/FEC path: single-purpose deshredder tuned for Agave merkle sizing; leaves ledger/rpc out of the hot path.
- Config is JSONC/env: secrets (RPC) in env, behavior (watch ids, logging) in JSONC.
- Composable stages: receiver → deshred → watcher → detailer → sink; each stage can be swapped or reused.
- Signal-first logging: emoji at a glance, vote-filtered by default, and mint-level detail with adapters.
- Small, dependency-light SDK crate backing a CLI client; intended to embed into larger consumers as well.

Quick choices:

- Want a one-call loop? Use `handle_pumpfun_watcher` in your own binary and set your own watch IDs/env as needed.
- Need to act on detections (e.g., push to a queue, custom filtering, alternate watchers/detailers)? Use the modular pipeline (`decode_udp_datagram` → `insert_shred` → `deshred_shreds_to_entries` → `collect_watch_events`) and hook your own sink right after detection (see `client/shreds-udp-rs` custom hook example).

Minimal usage example (Rust):

```rust
use solana_stream_sdk::shreds_udp::{ShredsUdpConfig, ShredsUdpState, DeshredPolicy, handle_pumpfun_watcher};
use solana_stream_sdk::UdpShredReceiver;
use std::sync::Arc;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error + Send + Sync>> {
    let cfg = ShredsUdpConfig::from_env(); // reads SHREDS_UDP_CONFIG jsonc too
    let mut receiver = UdpShredReceiver::bind(&cfg.bind_addr, None).await?;
    let policy = DeshredPolicy { require_code_match: cfg.require_code_match };
    let watch_cfg = Arc::new(cfg.watch_config());
    let state = ShredsUdpState::new(&cfg);
    loop {
        handle_pumpfun_watcher(&mut receiver, &state, &cfg, policy, watch_cfg.clone()).await?;
    }
}
```

Modular pipeline example (custom watch set):

```rust
use solana_stream_sdk::shreds_udp::{
    collect_watch_events, decode_udp_datagram, deshred_shreds_to_entries, insert_shred,
    DeshredPolicy, ShredInsertOutcome, ShredSource, ShredsUdpConfig, ShredsUdpState,
};
use solana_stream_sdk::txn::{ProgramWatchConfig, SplTokenMintFinder};
use solana_stream_sdk::UdpShredReceiver;
use std::sync::Arc;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error + Send + Sync>> {
    let cfg = ShredsUdpConfig::from_env();
    let mut receiver = UdpShredReceiver::bind(&cfg.bind_addr, None).await?;
    let policy = DeshredPolicy { require_code_match: cfg.require_code_match };
    let state = ShredsUdpState::new(&cfg);
    let watch_cfg = Arc::new(
        ProgramWatchConfig::new(vec![], vec![]) // define your own watch set
            .with_mint_finder(Arc::new(SplTokenMintFinder))
            .with_detailers(Vec::new()),
    );

    loop {
        let datagram = receiver.recv_raw().await?;
        if let Some(decoded) = decode_udp_datagram(&datagram, &state, &cfg).await {
            if let ShredInsertOutcome::Ready(ready) =
                insert_shred(decoded, &datagram, &state, &cfg, &policy).await
            {
                let entries = deshred_shreds_to_entries(&ready.shreds)?;
                let txs: Vec<_> = entries.iter().flat_map(|e| e.transactions.iter()).collect();
                let _hits = collect_watch_events(ready.key.slot, &txs, watch_cfg.as_ref(), 0);
                state.remove_batch(&ready.key).await;
                if matches!(ready.source, ShredSource::Data) {
                    state.mark_completed(ready.key).await;
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## ⚠️ Experimental Filtering Feature Notice

Filtering remains experimental on the **Shreds gRPC** path (`shreds-rs`, `shreds-ts`): requests should send empty filter maps because shreds-side filters are not usable yet. Geyser gRPC filters are fine. For workloads that need filtering, prefer the high-speed, customizable UDP shreds pipeline described above. Occasionally, data may not be fully available, and filters may not be applied correctly on the shreds gRPC path.

If you encounter such cases, please report them by opening an issue at: https://github.com/ValidatorsDAO/solana-stream/issues

Your feedback greatly assists our debugging efforts and overall improvement of this feature.
